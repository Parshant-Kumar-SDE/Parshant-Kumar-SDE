### Hi there, I'm Parshant 👋
I am an Ops & QA specialist transitioning into **Software Engineering**.
I am currently following a rigorous roadmap to master **Python** and **Data Structures** to solve scalable problems.
 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: **Python Automation & Algorithms**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Data Structures & Cloud Architecture**
- 🥅 2026 Goal: **Software Engineer at Google**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have 4 years of experience in E-commerce Ops, so I know what happens when code breaks in production!
